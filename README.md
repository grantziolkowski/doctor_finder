Basic BackboneJS app rendering views from a collection of doctor data found in `search.json`.

The testing suite runs on `testem` which handles all of the dependencies including `mocha.js`, `chai.js`, `sinon.js` and `sinon-chai.js`. From the project's root directory in the command line, run `testem` which will run browser tests at the default url:

`http://localhost:7357/`.

To view the app, from the project's root directory in the command line, make sure the `run` script is executable by typing `chmod u+x run`.

Start the server with the command `./run` and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/` in the browser.

The two images are stock images with their local urls hard-coded into the `search.json` JSON data.
